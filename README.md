### Why Do I Need Dart?
Due to [Sass Lang](https://sass-lang.com/)'s decision to move to Dart, it requires implementors to interface with it via Dart.<br>
You will need to install the [Dark SDK](https://dart.dev/) and, therefore [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). Simplified instructions on how to do this are below.
### Installation
1. Open Windows Terminal and make sure you are in a PowerShell tab with it pointing to the same directory as the setup.ps1.
2. Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process` then `.\setup.ps1`.
3. Done! Simple right?
